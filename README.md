# pandoc-plot - A pandoc filter to generate figures directly from documents

`pandoc-plot` turns code blocks present in your documents into embedded figures, using your plotting toolkit of choice.

## Usage

The filter recognizes code blocks with classes that match plotting toolkits. For example, using the `matplotlib` toolkit:

~~~markdown
# My document

This is a paragraph.

```{.matplotlib}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure()
plt.plot([0,1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4,5])
plt.title('This is an example figure')
```
~~~

Putting the above in `input.md`, we can then generate the plot and embed it in an HTML page:

```bash
pandoc --filter pandoc-plot input.md --output output.html
```

## Supported toolkits

`pandoc-plot` currently supports the following plotting toolkits (installed separately):

* `matplotlib`: plots using the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) Python library;
* `plotly` : plots using the [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) Python library;
* `matlabplot`: plots using [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/);
* `mathplot` : plots using [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/);
* `octaveplot`: plots using [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/);

To know which toolkits are useable on *your machine* (and which ones are not available), you can check with the `--toolkits/-t` flag:

```bash
pandoc-plot --toolkits
```

### In progress

Support for the following plotting toolkits is coming:

* [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/)
* [Plotly R](https://plot.ly/r/)
* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

## Features

### Captions

You can also specify a caption for your image. This is done using the optional `caption` parameter.

__Markdown__:

~~~markdown
```{.matlabplot caption="This is a simple figure"}
x  = 0: .1 : 2*pi;
y1 = cos(x);
y2 = sin(x);

figure
plot(x, y1, 'b', x, y2, 'r-.', 'LineWidth', 2)
```
~~~

__LaTex__:

```latex
\begin{minted}[caption=This is a simple figure]{matlabplot}
x  = 0: .1 : 2*pi;
y1 = cos(x);
y2 = sin(x);

figure
plot(x, y1, 'b', x, y2, 'r-.', 'LineWidth', 2)
\end{minted}
```

Caption formatting is either plain text or Markdown. LaTeX-style math is also support in captions (using dollar signs $...$).

### Link to source code

In case of an output format that supports links (e.g. HTML), the embedded image generated by `pandoc-plot` can show a link to the source code which was used to generate the file. Therefore, other people can see what code was used to create your figures. 

You can turn this off via the `source=true` key:

__Markdown__:

~~~markdown
```{.mathplot source=true}
...
```
~~~

__LaTex__:

```latex
\begin{minted}[source=true]{mathplot}
...
\end{minted}
```

or via a [configuration file](#Configuration).

### Preamble scripts

If you find yourself always repeating some steps, inclusion of scripts is possible using the `preamble` parameter. For example, if you want all Matplotlib plots to have the [`ggplot`](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-customizing-py) style, you can write a very short preamble `style.py` like so:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('ggplot')
```

and include it in your document as follows:

~~~markdown
```{.matplotlib preamble=style.py}
plt.figure()
plt.plot([0,1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4,5])
plt.title('This is an example figure')
```
~~~

Which is equivalent to writing the following markdown:

~~~markdown
```{.matplotlib}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('ggplot')

plt.figure()
plt.plot([0,1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4,5])
plt.title('This is an example figure')
```
~~~

The equivalent LaTeX usage is as follows:

```latex
\begin{minted}[include=style.py]{matplotlib}

\end{minted}
```

This `preamble` parameter is perfect for longer documents with many plots. Simply define the style you want in a separate script! You can also import packages this way, or define functions you often use.

### No wasted work

`pandoc-plot` minimizes work, only generating figures if it absolutely must, i.e. if the content has changed. Therefore, you can confidently run the filter on very large documents containing dozens of figures --- like a book or a thesis --- and only the figures which have changed will be re-generated.

### Compatibility with pandoc-crossref

[`pandoc-crossref`](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref) is a pandoc filter that makes it effortless to cross-reference objects in Markdown documents. 

You can use `pandoc-crossref` in conjunction with `pandoc-plot` for the ultimate figure-making pipeline. You can combine both in a figure like so:

~~~markdown
```{#fig:myexample .plotly_python caption="This is a caption"}
# Insert figure script here
```

As you can see in @fig:myexample, ...
~~~

If the above source is located in file `myfile.md`, you can render the figure and references by applying `pandoc-plot` **first**, and then `pandoc-crossref`. For example:

```bash
pandoc --filter pandoc-plot --filter pandoc-crossref -i myfile.md -o myfile.html
```
